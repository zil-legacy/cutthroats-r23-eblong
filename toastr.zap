	.GSTR STR?352,"You are at the stern of this wreck. The deck continues forward."
	.GSTR STR?353,"Your airhose catches and tears on the way down."
	.GSTR STR?354,"the mast"
	.GSTR STR?355,"upper hole"
	.GSTR STR?356,"lower hole"
	.GSTR STR?357,"This cabin was apparently used for storage, although what's left can only be described as debris. There is an exit abaft, a doorway outlined with barnacle-encrusted timbers. There is a hole above your head through which a broken-off mast descends."
	.GSTR STR?358,"This cabin seems to have been sleeping quarters. It must have been used by the crew, as it is spartanly furnished. The only ways out of this room are up and down."

	.GSTR STR?360,"cut it with that."
	.GSTR STR?361,"the top knot"
	.GSTR STR?362,"This area is full of barnacle-encrusted iron bars, probably pikes used by the sailors for fending off boarding parties. There is a plaque on one wall. Exits are fore and aft."
	.GSTR STR?363,"Water rushes into the room, making you realize the value of your equipment."
	.GSTR STR?364,"This heavy iron bar was probably used as a pike."
	.GSTR STR?365,"plaque"
	.GSTR STR?366,"fallen partition"
	.GSTR STR?367,"As you return to a watery environment, you realize the value of leaving your equipment on."
	.GSTR STR?368,"This was a galley or a pantry, though only the shape and size of the cabin suggest that. There are exits fore and aft."
	.GSTR STR?369,"This former dining room has some tables upturned and scattered about, a door forward, a hole through the floor, and a narrow opening abaft."
	.GSTR STR?370,"Amidst a stack of rotted wood is a cask that is still in one piece."
	.GSTR STR?371,"climb the rope with that load."
	.GSTR STR?372,"stack of rotted wood"
	.GSTR STR?373,"bunch of overturned tables"
	.GSTR STR?374,"As you begin to move, you suddenly find yourself breathing water! Your airhose tore on some of the sharper debris."
	.GSTR STR?375,"The settling of debris has left a very narrow passage through this cabin. You can go forward or aft."
	.GSTR STR?376," wedged under the bunks."
	.GSTR STR?377,"debris"
	.GSTR STR?378,"You are in a bunk-lined cabin. The forward bulkhead has an open doorway in it, and a ladder leads down through the deck. The rotting interior of the hull lies aft."
	.GSTR STR?379,"This might have been the purser's cabin. It can be exited forward through a narrow opening."
	.GSTR STR?380,"Except for two broken rungs at the bottom, this ladder looks as if it's in good shape."
	.GSTR STR?381,"the combination"
	.GSTR STR?382,"You can go aft from this cabin, a small and claustrophobic area little more than a widened passageway, or through a jagged hole in the port bulkhead."
	.GSTR STR?383,"This cabin is the third-class passengers' quarters. There couldn't have been many frills here since the remains are spartan. The cabin can be exited aft and up."
	.GSTR STR?384,"get off the chest"
	.GSTR STR?385,"As the chest starts to rise, you fall off it rather awkwardly and disconnect your airhose."
	.GSTR STR?386,"This jagged hole is the result of centuries of wear on the hull."
	.GSTR STR?387," to take with you"
	.GSTR STR?388,"As you move away from the hole, your airhose gets caught on the edge of the hole in the wreck! As it tears, you find that breathing water is beyond your talents."
	.GSTR STR?389,", dragging the chest up with it."
	.GSTR STR?390,"."
	.GSTR STR?391,"This room, which may have been a lounge, can be exited fore or aft."
	.GSTR STR?392,"This was once the supplies locker, with exits forward and up, and a door with a sign on it in the aft bulkhead."
	.GSTR STR?393,"barnacle"
	.GSTR STR?394,"Although this sword is old and worn, it is still moderately sharp."
	.GSTR STR?395,"You're in one of the large holds of the ship, impressive in size. There are rooms fore and aft, and a hole in the port bulkhead."
	.GSTR STR?396,"This had to have been a mine locker. There is a door forward and a passage above your head."
	.GSTR STR?397,"BOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM!"
	.GSTR STR?398,"This is another cabin used to house the ship's crew. There are exits forward and aft."
	.GSTR STR?399,"There is a giant squid sleeping here."
	.GSTR STR?400,"This cabin has suffered the ravages of the sea. Above your head at one end of the cabin a ladder leads up. The bottom two rungs of the ladder are broken, but the rest of it seems to be pretty sturdy. A doorway, outlined by rotting timbers, leads forward."
	.GSTR STR?401,"high enough to get past the two broken rungs"
	.GSTR STR?402,"He is wiry, hyper, and devoid of ethics. A fat cigar seems to be his only companion, since he's the type of man who would sell his own mother if given the opportunity."
	.GSTR STR?403," He"
	.GSTR STR?404,"The Weasel turns and yells, ""Traitor!"" Next thing you know, you've been stabbed."
	.GSTR STR?405,"""Thanks for the info, pal, but I better make sure you don't use it."" He pulls out his gun and shoots."
	.GSTR STR?406,"McGinty walks in the front door, spots something in the shadows, pulls out a gun, and fires. Unfortunately, you are what he noticed."
	.GSTR STR?407,"A moment later, McGinty sticks his head out, asks why you were in his place, and shoots you."
	.GSTR STR?408,"McGinty"
	.GSTR STR?409,"A Supremo it's not."
	.GSTR STR?410,"lit"
	.GSTR STR?411,"Red got his name from flame-red hair which sprouts from his head and face, and peeks out from under his flannel shirt. He takes no guff, but he is fair and has a sense of justice."
	.GSTR STR?412,"grins"
	.GSTR STR?413,"showed me this"
	.GSTR STR?414,"""Tie the line to the treasure when you've got it, then pull on it and we'll pull the treasure up."""
	.GSTR STR?415,"Pete wears an eyepatch and got his name on a far-east voyage as the cook. The food ran out, and he did what he could to supply the crew with fresh meat. Needless to say, he was left at the nearest port."
	.GSTR STR?416,"The Weasel is a small, greasy man with shifty eyes. He loves his sharp little knife more than life itself, and would sell out anybody for a price. Even himself."
	.GSTR STR?417,"The Weasel, quite panic-stricken, doesn't stop to thank you before he pulls a small knife from his ankle and kills you."
	.GSTR STR?418,"The Weasel glares at you and says, ""I don't take this from no one!"" He pulls out his knife, touches its too-sharp point with a finger, then introduces it to your chest."
	.GSTR STR?419,"his card"
	.GSTR STR?420,"the envelope"
	.GSTR STR?421,"You can't help notice that your dresser has been opened and the contents messed up."
	.GSTR STR?422,"""That's one of McGinty's envelopes! Traitor!"" Before you can respond, the Weasel's knife has violated the sanctity of your body."

	.GSTR STR?433,"It bears the Hollywood Cruise Lines markings."
	.GSTR STR?434,"Pete spots McGinty, who is near enough to overhear! While Johnny chases McGinty, Pete accuses you of bringing McGinty along. Before you respond, the Weasel plunges his knife into your heart."
	.GSTR STR?435,"Johnny glares at McGinty. ""Trying to cash in on my work again, huh? You probably killed Hevlin, too!"" And with that, he pushes McGinty off the cliff.

""I can't leave witnesses,"" he mumbles. Before you can react, you're on your way down to join what's left of McGinty."
	.GSTR STR?436,"Johnny sees McGinty on the road. ""You brought McGinty, you traitor! You probably killed Hevlin, too!"" A moment later, you're falling down to the rocks."
	.GSTR STR?437,"Johnny stares at you in disgust. ""A drunk diving for us? You'll probably tell McGinty, too. I'll make sure you don't."" He pushes you off the cliff. Although you feel no pain, your landing is fatal."
	.GSTR STR?438,"Johnny looks disgusted. ""No money? You probably told McGinty already. Traitor!"" He pushes you off the cliff, and you scream as the pointy rocks rush up to meet you."
	.GSTR STR?439,"Johnny looks disgusted. ""I can't wait all day..."" You feel a shove and then find yourself on your way down to the rocks below."
	.GSTR STR?440,"shakes his head"

	.GSTR STR?445,"You are awakened by what feels like your ship running aground. You are put back to a permanent sleep by the Weasel's knife."

	.GSTR STR?447,"find something to drink soon!"
	.GSTR STR?448,"The giant squid stirs and sees what disturbed it. When the huge eyes spot you, it moves toward you and hugs you with its tentacles. You squirm in an attempt to get away, but more arms surround you and one disconnects your airhose."
	.GSTR STR?449," swims up to you and starts nibbling."
	.GSTR STR?450,"The row of fallen bunks pinches your airhose. A few moments later, it is impossible to breathe."
	.GSTR STR?451,"You find yourself gasping for air, but there's none to breathe!"
	.GSTR STR?452,"You've used all your air."
	.GSTR STR?453,"There's not enough air to breathe!"
	.GSTR STR?454,"You suddenly find Red's hands around your throat as he makes a comment about hating cowards and Hevlin being wrong."
